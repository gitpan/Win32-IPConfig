Revision history for Perl extension Win32::IPConfig.

** 0.01 2003-01-20

Discovered that some NDIS WAN Adapters on NT 4.0 do not have an
<adapter>\Parameters\Tcpip key. Changed code to skip adapters
that don't have this key.

Discovered also that a NDIS WAN Adapter on NT 4.0 could have a static
ip address of 0.0.0.0, so commented out the sanity check for static
ip addresses.

Discovered that an adapter could be enabled for DHCP but
not have dhcp values (because it was not connected to the network).
Changed extraction of dhcp ip address, dhcp dns servers, dhcp wins
servers, and dhcp gateways to check for the existence of the value
before assignment.
